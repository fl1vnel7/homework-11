              >he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite is something
              that runs deep within everyone, even though most people don't take
              the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like
              people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest
              amount of attention, settling for something much less than
              respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any
              relationship grow is by showing respect. <br /><br />
              I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected.
              What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special
              attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how
              highly they are valued.
